 * A variant of an n-ary tree which stores characters at each node.
 * Each path down the tree results in a valid word
 *
 * * nodes (null nodes) indicate end of word
 *
 * Uses:
 *  - store an entire language for quick prefix lookups.
 *  Hashtables can verify whether a word is valid but not a prefix - tries can do this in o(k) time, where K is length of string
